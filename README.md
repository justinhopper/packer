# Packer Diff Patch

Apply this diff patch to v1.7.1 Packer to enable Azure Shared Image Gallery creation on the fly

TODO: Possibly put image definition creation code in separate file, possibly as a "step" like other creation code.
      Still trying to get stored image version to store with Premium disk type instead of Standard
